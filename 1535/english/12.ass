Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.14,0:03:51.06,Default,,0,0,0,,This implies that the second Kira
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.14,0:03:53.40,Default,,0,0,0,,only needs to see a person's face\Nto kill them.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.00,0:06:24.17,Default,,0,0,0,,The truth is, if I was the only one\Nwho thought there was a second Kira,
